title: Using Class Attributes to Get Gid of Your Database
---

p. I recently created a Vocabulary Formatting Rails app for my wife to use at work. I tried to create the program as quickly as possible, and by habit I set up a database using ActiveRecord. Once I was done, my Formatter class model looked like this:

bc.. class Formatter < ActiveRecord::Base

  def arrayed
    content.split(/\r\n/)
  end

  def randomize
    arrayed.shuffle
  end

  def alphabetize
    arrayed.sort
  end

  def numberize(array)
    i=0
    array.collect do |word|
      i += 1
      "#{i}. #{word}"
    end
  end

  def format
    if order == "random" && numbered == true
      return numberize(randomize)
    elsif order == "random" && numbered == false
      return randomize
    elsif order == "alpha" && numbered == true
      return numberize(alphabetize)
    elsif order == "alpha" && numbered == false
      return alphabetize
    else
      return ["You did not pick a format. Please select Random or Alhabetize."]
    end
  end

end

p. After I got the app running, I realized I only needed one model, and one view, for the program to do everything it needed. There also was no need for a database, as no vocabulary lists needed to be saved for future use. So it became apparent
