<ul>
  <li><a href="https://vocabformatter.herokuapp.com/">Vocabulary Formatter</a> - Basic list organizer. Dump a list of vocabulary words into text area and click desired format.  Alphabetize, randomize, and numbered options.</li>
  <li><a href="https://customgroups.herokuapp.com/">Custom Groups</a> - Set up accont, create your classes, and fill your rosters. Setting class preferences allows you to require all seemingly random group generations to be gender-mixed, and optionally specify special case students that should not be grouped together. With these special cases hidden in the program's class settings, you can share the randomizer view with your class without needing to broadcast the healthy restrictions your class needs to thrive.</li>
